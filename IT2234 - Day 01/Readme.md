# JavaScript Programs

## Overview
This repository contains three simple JavaScript programs that demonstrate basic concepts such as printing messages, performing arithmetic operations, and looping through numbers.

## Files

### 1. `Pro1.js`
- A basic script that prints `"Hello world!"` to the console.

### 2. `Pro2.js`
- Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers (`a = 20`, `b = 10`).
- Outputs the results to the console.

### 3. `Pro3.js`
- Prints numbers from 1 to 10.
- Prints only odd numbers between 1 and 10.
- Prints numbers from 10 to 1 in reverse order.
- Implements a custom logic for reversing numbers in a different format.
